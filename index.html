            <h3>Step-free route</h3>

 

            <p>

                Hampton Court Palace is an historic building and, therefore, has

                uneven surfaces. There is however a step-free route from the Palace

                Gardens to Palace Courtyard please ask the stewards for assistance

                with this route. Within Base Court, there are six wheelchair spaces

                and six complimentary companion seats per concert on the wheelchair

                platform.

            </p>

 

            <p>

                We offer a companion ticket for visitors with disabilities who require

                assistance. This is a complimentary ticket for a partner, accompanying

                friend or personal assistant (PA). Companion tickets, with exclusion

                of the wheelchair platform, are subject to availability.

            </p>

 

            <h3>Accessible parking</h3>

 

            <p>

                Please note that we offer complimentary blue badge parking which MUST

                be booked in advance of your visit as blue badge spaces are limited.

                Parking requests will close on midday on the day of your concert.

                After you have completed your purchase, you will be asked to input

                your blue badge number and your registration plate alongside your

                supporting documentation such as your blue badge. You will also need

                to present your blue badge upon arrival at the event. Accessible
